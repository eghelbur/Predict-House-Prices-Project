# Boston Housing Price Prediction

## Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict the median value of homes in Boston. Using the classic Boston Housing dataset, this regression model accounts for various features of residential areas.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 506 records, each with 13 features that describe aspects of residential homes in Boston from the 1970s. The features are as follows:

### Features
- `CrimeRate`: Per capita crime rate by town.
- `LargeLots`: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
- `IndustrialProportion`: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
- `CharlesRiver`: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river, 0 otherwise).
- `NitricOxideConc`: Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million).
- `AvgRoomsPerDwelling`: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
- `ProportionOldHomes`: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.
- `DistToEmploymentCenters`: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centers.
- `HighwayAccessibilityIndex`: Index of accessibility to radial highways.
- `PropertyTaxRate`: Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.
- `StudentTeacherRatio`: Pupil-teacher ratio by town.
- `BlackResidentProportion`: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of black residents by town.
- `LowerStatusPopulation`: Percentage of lower status of the population.

### Target
- `MedianHomeValue`: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's.

## Requirements
The project is implemented in Python and requires the following libraries:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Joblib

## Installation and Usage
Details for setting up the environment and using the model for predictions can be found in the [Installation](#installation) and [Usage](#usage) sections below.

## Model Performance
The model's performance, evaluated by R-squared and Mean Squared Error, indicates a strong predictive power and is detailed in the [Model Performance](#model-performance) section.
